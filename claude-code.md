We are creating an AI powered analyst platform using FastApi for backend and google-adk for creating the agents (which will perform actions).

For that, let's follow the following planning approach:
- First, create a requirements.md doc containing all the necessary requirements for building the backend and the agents
- Second, we will use the requirements.md doc to create a design.md which has detailed flowcharts and architecture diagrams of the backend and the agents and how they interact with the front-end of the platform
- Third, using the requirements.md doc and the design.md file, we will finally come up with a set of tasks (tasks.md) containing a list of all the tasks to be performed for creating the platform's backend and agents

Alright, let me now provide the end-to-end flow of a typical user who uses the platform
Note: There are two types of users who use this platform: Founders and Investors.

## Founder user flow
Founder logs into the platform -> Founders upload company details -> Founders upload pitch deck/keynotes along with an optional video/audio recording of the actual pitch/demo -> Agent analyses the company details and pitch deck , build a detailed description along with all required parameters for the specific sector/market/niche the company operates in , fill in these details with the one provided by founder along with details mentioned in pitch deck and the audio/video demo (the info from which is extracted by another agent) -> Agent determines extra information still required from founders in forms of question which will be displayed on frontend -> Founder will answer these extra questions and submit the form -> all details till gather so far are send to backend for further processing -> Founder will be shown "profile under review" -> In the backend, the agents are working to create `investment memo 1.0` using all the information collected so far -> After a certain amount of time (once the `investment memo 1.0` is generated... note: it will not be shown to the founder at all), the founder will see an option to take an interview/call with an AI Agent -> Founders will see notification and can accept the call -> Check microphone and camera -> Start call -> A transcript will be shown on the side, AI will ask questions founder will answer and conversation will take place -> All this call information will be processed in the backend to create a refined `investment memo 2.0`, which will be shown to the investor

## Investor user flow
The investor logs in the platform -> Investor can set their preferences at the start (first time), this will be saved in investor's profile. An option to edit the preferences if required in profile section on top right -> A basic page showcasing all the companies(founders) with a search option with different filters for market/sector etc (decide all relevant parameters based on information stored for a company/founder) this list will be sorted based on their preferences by default -> Investor can select a company they like and more detailed information of the company/market/sector will be shown which was processed in the backend previosuly (All the details in investment memo 2.0) -> If investor want they have an option to schedule a call with founders for further communication

- ### Required Agents:
  1. summarize_agent: This agent takes in all the data provided by the founder (such as pitch decks, ppts, keynotes and audio/video demos) and then prepares a detailed description with all the necessary and relevant parameters specific to the sector/market and niche that the company operates in.
  2. questionnaire_agent: This agent will take in the summary generated by the `summarize_agent` and then based on the industry/sector where the startup operates in, prepares a list of relevant questions that should be answered by the founders. Note: These questions should be in such a way that they are not answerable with the current summary information available.
  3. investment_memo_agent: This agent now with all the extra information along with the data provided by the founder initially, creates a comprehensive deal-note/investment-memo which will contain detailed information such as the following:
    - Market data analysis -> Analyze public market data available for the market the company operates in
    - Founder's profile analysis -> Analyze founders LinkedIn profile, Twitter account and other social media profile and any public news
    - Company profile analysis -> Analyze public company news/communications and any other public data available like employee/product reviews etc
    - Competition Analysis -> Analyze all public data for major and minor competition for this company
    - After all this data is analyzed an investment memo 1.0 will be created and the initial memo will be updated accordingly (like, with more information such as call details and transcripts between the founder and investor, the second version of the investment memo (`investment memo 2.0`) will be created)
